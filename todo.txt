TODO  - start bootstrap clean blog
RELEASE
- takes fucking ages to load initially

- resize mast head on mobile - dont worry about vertical
- console errors
- load only what needed, previews availavble, more previews, post currently looking at.
- client building twice etc, script fucked for heroku.

- /api/ -> more clearly defines request seperation
- async / await
- suspense / lazy.
- og logic ie posts/previews all make sense and work?
- login password hidden


EXTRA
- create own cloudinary
- change from token to session
- User db instead of hardcode
- to lower case, trim
- learn from albert- check his practices in portal
- remove alerts - use plan for portal ie highlight red
- someone trying to contact lulu, make sure they get feedback on form submit
- register service worker and manifest.json
- publish button. related to isPrivate. autosave drafts (after timer?) and at end. default to private.
- check .env file vs heroky config vars.
- set up seperate branches for dev/prod hiding/using keys for local/git/heroku
- Make sure images on cloudinary, and all blog posts exactly reflect what is on site - everything gets deleted, edited as should.

- editing banner image
- figure out the slow stuff before using lazy etc.
- drop all from dev/prod - reset ids.
